## Introduction and Motivation
A web application is an interactive computer program developed using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), which stores (Database, Files) and manipulates data (CRUD - create, read, update and delete). Webapps can be used by a team or single user to perform tasks over the internet.


## How We Have Applied Human Computer Interaction design principles: 
For this project, we have made our web app adhere to HCI design principles, such as visibility, feedback, consistency, flexibility, and error prevention. Consider the following aspects:
  1. **Information architecture:** Organize content and functionality to promote ease of use and understanding.
  2. **Navigation:** Provide clear and consistent navigation options.
  3. **User feedback:** Offer immediate and informative feedback to user actions.
  4. **Aesthetics:** Maintain a visually appealing and professional design.

## How We Tested Our Web App: 
Conducted usability testing with a small group of users which identified issues and some areas for improvement. We made any necessary changes based on the feedback received.

## How We Documented Our Work: 
We prepared a report that includes the following sections:
1. **Introduction:** Introduce our web app and its purpose.
2. **Usability goals:** Described the usability goals we set for your web app and explained how we addressed each goal.
3. **Design process:** Discussed our design process, from sketching to implementation.
4. **API integration:** Explained how we utilized the APIs and discuss any challenges or limitations encountered.
5. **Interactive widgets:** Described the widgets we incorporated and their purposes.
6. **HCI design principles:** Discussed how our web app adheres to HCI design principles.
7. **Testing and feedback:** Summarized the results of our usability testing and any changes made in response to feedback.
8. **Conclusion:** Reflected on our experience and discuss potential future improvements.
